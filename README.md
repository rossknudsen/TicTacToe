# README #

This is the source code for my university assignment to construct a webserver using raw sockets.  The
architecture must include a webserver and an application server (in this case a game server).  

### How do I get set up? ###

You should be able to download the source code and run it without any configuration using Visual Studio
2017.  Earlier versions may work too, but have not been tested.

The source is currently Copyright to Ross Knudsen - this may change in the future.
